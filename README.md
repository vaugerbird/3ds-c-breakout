# 3DS-C Breakout
My take on the original 3DS-C board. Truth be told, I designed my board before doing any actual research, so I had no clue that a project like this already existed. I didn't want my work to go to waste though, so I'm opting to fork and add my board as a remix of sorts.

Make sure to remove and completly clean the pads for the dock pins, as my board forgos the dock and covers the pads. If you do not clean the pads the board may not sit flat.

All other warnings and instructions from the original repository also apply here, but please check BOM.ods because I have different parts designed in my board.
