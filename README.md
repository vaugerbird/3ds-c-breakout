# 3DS-C Breakout
My take on the original 3DS-C board. Truth be told I designed my board before doing any actual research, so I had no clue that a project like this already existed. I didn't want my work to go to waste though, so I'm opting to fork and add my board as a remix of sorts.

All of the warnings and instructions from the original repository also apply here, but please check BOM.ods because I have different parts designed in my board.
